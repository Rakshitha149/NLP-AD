However, the negative dengue and malaria tests and mostly normal liver and kidney function are reassuring. The high antibody levels to *Salmonella Typhi* suggest a possible past or present typhoid infection should be investigated further by his doctor.  The slightly low values (RBC, Sodium, Chloride) should also be investigated to determine if they represent a clinical problem.  His doctor should correlate these findings with his clinical presentation to determine the best course of action.  This explanation is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice. A physician should interpret this report in the context of the patient's medical history and clinical presentation.\n",
