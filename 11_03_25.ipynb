But then something shifted.  I realized that spending a few hours on the weekend prepping healthy meals meant less stress and healthier choices during the week.\n> \n> This week's triumph? The picture says it all!  Two perfectly portioned containers of teriyaki chicken and veggies over fluffy white rice.  Tender chicken marinated in a sweet and savory teriyaki sauce is perfectly complemented by vibrant roasted red peppers, crunchy carrots, and florets of fresh broccoli.  All nestled comfortably on a bed of steamed rice – it's a complete and satisfying meal that's ready in minutes.\n> \n> My meal prep journey wasn't instantaneous. It started with small steps. I began by prepping one or two components, like chopping vegetables,  then gradually added more until I could prep full meals ahead of time.  I started with simple recipes, like this teriyaki chicken and rice, slowly building confidence as I experimented with more complex dishes.\n> \n> The key, I discovered, is planning and organization. I dedicate a specific time slot on the weekend, put on some music, and get to work.  Knowing I’ve got healthy, delicious meals waiting for me in the fridge makes all the difference. No more last-minute takeout decisions or resorting to unhealthy convenience foods!\n> \n> This is my current routine but I'm looking to expand with things like soups and salads to keep things interesting! If you’re on the fence about meal prepping, trust me, take the leap! It’s an investment in your health and sanity – and the deliciousness is an added bonus!  What are your favourite meal prep meals? Share them in the comments!\n"
